-- In order to actually use the attributes of an exposed record, you have to expose it into the current namespace.
-- Things like Foo.foos.foobar do not work.
-- Because... Elm looks for a module named Foo.foos?  That seems odd.
-- That seems borne out by tests.  With the following `exposing` line,
-- addresses.logRequest works.  However, after this,
-- I tried (.logRequest GlobalActions.addresses), and that also worked.
-- Being that direct function application works, of course it can be
-- rewritten with forward application into (GlobalActions.addresses |> .logRequest)
-- Which reads more sensically except for the random `|>`.
